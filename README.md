# Centipede Shield Library

## Reference

The main documentation is reported in [macetech wiki](https://docs.macetech.com/doku.php/centipede_shield)

Nevertheless this could be outdated (eg .getIntF is missing in the wiki currently).

## Methods

* .digitalWrite([0...127], [LOW...HIGH]) - Acts like normal digitalWrite
* .digitalRead([0...127]) - Acts like normal digitalRead
* .pinMode([0...127], [INPUT...OUTPUT]) - Acts like normal pinMode
* .pinPullup([0...127], [LOW...HIGH]) - Activates internal 100K pullups on inputs when HIGH.
* .portWrite([0...7], [0...65535]) - Writes 16-bit value to one port (chip). Useful for writing 16 outputs at the same time.
* .portRead([0...7]) - Reads 16-bit value from one port (chip)
* .portMode([0...7], [0...65535]) - Write I/O mask to one port (chip). In binary, a 0 means output and a 1 means input. Easier to use than a long list of pinMode() commands.
* .portPullup([0...7], [0...65535]) - Sets pullups on one port (chip). In binary, a 0 means no pullup and a 1 means pullup is active.
* .portInterrupts([0...7],[0...65535],[0...65535],[0...65535]) - Configure interrupts
*                 [device number],[use interrupt on pin],[default value],[interrupt when != default]
* .portCaptureRead(0...7) - Reads 16-bit value registers as they were when interrupt occurred
* .getIntF(0..7) - These return an interrupt flag state that allows you to determine which port (device) produced an interrupt (and it could be more than one device).
* .init() - Sets all registers to initial values

## Compile Options

if `CS_CACHE` is defined, the library will use sightly more memory, but will allow `.digitalRead([0-127, [TRUE|FALSE])` where the latter parametet will define if to return the value cached or if has to be taken fresh from the port.
If you read all the 127 input from i2c, this should br faster, at the price of 512 byte of memory.
